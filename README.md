# FedGraphHE
This repository provides the key modules of FedGraphHE, a privacy-preserving federated graph neural network framework featuring dynamic homomorphic encryption and robust aggregation. To align with academic and intellectual property norms prior to formal publication, we are currently sharing the essential components necessary to understand and validate the core methodology.  In the spirit of collaborative and reproducible research, the full implementation—including complete training pipelines, configuration scripts, and experimental code—will be released concurrently with the formal acceptance of our accompanying manuscript by PLOS ONE.
